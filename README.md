# led brightness control


This project is similar to the sound volume control on a mobile device, where the user can increase or decrease the volume using the volume buttons on the device. In this project, the user can increase or decrease the brightness of the LED using the pushbuttons. The pushbuttons act as a control interface for adjusting the brightness level of the LED, similar to how the volume buttons act as a control interface for adjusting the volume level on a mobile device.
